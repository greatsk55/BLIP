      "1": {
        "question": "Is there really no record left?",
        "answer": "All conversation content is 100% end-to-end encrypted, so only unreadable ciphertext passes through the server. Hosting systems (Vercel, AWS, etc.) may retain minimal connection logs, which is beyond our control—but those logs contain nothing but meaningless random data."

      "3": {
        "question": "Can I send images and files?",
        "answer": "Yes! Images and videos are sent directly between users via encrypted P2P (WebRTC). The server never sees your media—data is double-encrypted and relayed through a TURN server only when direct connection isn't possible."

If the admin token is lost, you must immediately report it to the BLIP operations team. Upon receiving the report, the community will be closed and the administrator must create a new community to migrate members; (4) comply with all applicable laws regarding user-generated content within their community. BLIP provides encryption and infrastructure only.
